# pelerine
pelerine is a wrapper for circuit-python intended to behave just like gpiozero

It is created for educational purposes. It can be used for children who have just learnt to use gpiozero with RPi and need to proceed to microcontrollers with the same commands.

The same commands format just like gpiozero is used but circuitpython is executed under the hood.

If you need an introduction to Adafruit Trinket M0 (a microcontroller that uses circuitpython) and Mu Editor, you may check this link, when I first tried this concept.

The wrapper development has just begun. Classes and methods will be added gradually. If you need a specific electronic component to be supported please notify me at ezeakis@gmail.com
